### Results

**— Product recommendation 1. Reconsider the design of the sending request form**

**What is the problem?**

The conversion rate between the motorbike page in the catalog and the user sending a request for a call page is quite small.

Perhaps the fact is that the application form does not attract the attention of users. In this case, its design should be reconsidered.

**— Product recommendation 2. Analyze the work of specialists from Kaliningrad**

To solve this problem, it is necessary to analyze the work of specialists from Kaliningrad whose duties include user calls processing.

**— Product recommendation 3. Test the product when it is opened through the VK**
